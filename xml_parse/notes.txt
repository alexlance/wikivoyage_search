Only appears to be 1 comment per page, and does not contain any useful information for us.
There appear to be some redirect pages, so we need to filter those out.

Rather than filter out unneeded pages, assume that the /* {{see|do/ is all we care about. So just search for that.
Worked effectively.

-Format of the data of a See is:
* {{ See| key_1=value_1 | key_2=value_2 }}
-So use | as our delimiter there and convert to a ruby hash
-the delimiter is sometimes surrounded by space so need to handle that.
-There can sometimes be no value so need to still extract the key with no value
-there can sometimes be the | delimiter in a value. But it looks to be always
surrounded by a pair of [[]]. So convert all | within those brackets to :
-There can be more than 1 | delimiters in the [[]] so need to handle any number
of them.
- There can be multiple '=' in a value. This happens with urls. So use the first
occurence of the '=' to be the key,value delimiter.
- There can be empty between delimiters ie. key=value | | key=value, so only look for a key value pair when there is an '=' in the string.
- No other problems
- checking value space for each key
- lat and lon all have valid values
- there are some points of interest with no names or alternate names. As they only number at 29, we can ignore those.
