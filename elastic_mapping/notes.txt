- Build simple mapping and upload content into the ES cluster
- Mapping works well, need to consider relevency now.
- We want to concatenate the page_title and name field for searching
  so that if we are searching for 'museums in berlin', removing stopwords,
  we can find the 'berlin' keyword in the page_title, and the 'museum' keyword
  in the page_title.

- Use the english ES analyzer to stem, lowercase and remove stopwords. We do this for
  the name_page_title field and the content field as those are the fields that we are going
  to be search on and finding relevency from.
